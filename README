To have ImageField, install Pillow
# pip install Pillow


Problem:
If git bash commit fails, meet this error
Admin@Desktop_PC MINGW64 /d/workspace/2017/fitheart_dj (master)
$ git add .
fatal: Unable to create 'D:/workspace/2017/fitheart_dj/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

Solution:
Try delete .index.lock in .git folder
and try again
git pull origin master
